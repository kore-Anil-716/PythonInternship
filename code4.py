# The code aims to implement the merge sort algorithm. However, there is a bug in the code. When the student runs this code, it will raise an error or produce incorrect output.
#  The student's task is to identify and correct the bug.

# Hint: Pay close attention to the recursive calls and the merging step.




# The issue with your code is that the `merge_sort` function doesn't return the sorted array.
#  The function sorts the array in-place but doesn't ensure that the sorted halves are returned back up the recursion stack.
#  This means that the original `arr` in the `main` function remains unmodified.

# To fix this, you should return `arr` at the end of the `merge_sort` function. Here's the corrected code:

def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = arr[:mid]
    right = arr[mid:]
    
    left = merge_sort(left)
    right = merge_sort(right)
    
    i = j = k = 0
    
    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] < right[j]:
            arr[k] = left[i]
            i += 1
        else:
            arr[k] = right[j]
            j += 1
        k += 1
    
    while i < len(left):
        arr[k] = left[i]
        i += 1
        k += 1
    
    while j < len(right):
        arr[k] = right[j]
        j += 1
        k += 1
